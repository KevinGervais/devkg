    <p> <strong>Commerce Life Cycle</strong> </p>
    <p>
      KevinGervais administrators give themselves the discretion to accept or reject commerce publication and modification.
      A commerce can only be deleted if there are no current or future purchases for the commerce.
      At any time, a user may choose to make a commerce approved by the KevinGervais administrator public or private
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Lifecycle of a purchase</strong> </p>
    <p>
      To request a purchase at KevinGervais, you must make a payment request with Paypal
      or Stripe which will only be accepted if the host accepts the booking.
      By making a booking request with a host, you are agreeing to the terms of use of the commerce requested by the host.
      Once the booking is approved,
      it is the responsibility of the renter and the host to meet
      at the time they agreed upon via our messaging service on the first day of the purchase.
      At the time of the initial commerce,
      the Host must take photos and answer questions about the terms of the commerce
      and then send them to KevinGervais for the particular booking.
      Then, the renter can approve or reject
      or reject the photos and answers to the terms of the commerce for that booking via KevinGervais.
      If the renter accepts the photos and the terms of the commerce, the host has to pass the commerce to the renter.
      If there is no transfer of the commerce on the first day of the purchase
      the booking will be transferred directly to the dispute management team where a decision will be made
      whether there will be a charge to the renter or the host.
      it is the responsibility of the renter and the host to meet
      at the time they have agreed upon via our courier service on the last day of the purchase.
      At the time of handing over the commerce,
      the renter must take photos and answer questions about the commerce's conditions
      and send them to KevinGervais for the purchase in question.
      Then the host can approve or reject
      or reject the photos and answers to the commerce's terms and conditions for that booking via KevinGervais.
      Whether the Host accepts or rejects the commerce condition and photos, the Renter is required to return the commerce.
      If the host or the renter considers that the conditions of KevinGervais and/or the conditions of the host have not been
      respected, they can request that the booking be transferred directly to the dispute management team
      where a decision will be made as to whether there will be a charge to the Renter or Host.
      If both the host and the renter have completed the booking, the deposit will be automatically refunded.
